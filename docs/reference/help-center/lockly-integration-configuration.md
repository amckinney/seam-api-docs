# Lockly Integration Configuration

The Lockly integration is supported by Seam but there is a limitation that it requires an initial manual setup step where someone at Seam will have to take the user's Lockly account details (API key, etc) and configure it in Seam. As part of this, Seam may need to contact Lockly on behalf of the user (if the user does not already have an API key). To get Lockly added to your account, please contact `enterprise.support@getseam.com`
