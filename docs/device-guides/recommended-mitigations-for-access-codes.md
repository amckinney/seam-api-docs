# Recommended Mitigations for Access Codes

Certain access code errors may require manual intervention to resolve. Mitigations are proactive measures you can implement in response to certain access code errors and warnings to ensure an access code will work reliably by the time it is needed.

When creating a scheduled access code, Seam will attempt to set the code on the device up to 9 days in advance and will save any errors or warnings on the access code at least 3 days prior to the scheduled start time of the code. The intention behind this is to provide you with enough time to respond to these error and warning messages using the recommended mitigations below.


| Error Code                       | Recommended Mitigation Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `failed_to_set_on_device`        | Check the error message for more specific mitigation steps or use a [backup access code](https://docs.seam.co/latest/core-concepts/access-codes#backup-access-codes)                                                                                                                                                               |
| `failed_to_remove_from_device`   | Check the error message for more specific mitigation steps. Confirm using the provider's app if the access code is still on the device, as it may have been deleted through another source.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `code_modified_external_to_seam` | To resolve a conflict due to a Seam access code being modified or created by an external source, you can delete and re-create the code through Seam or convert the code from an unmanaged to managed access code (if it was created by an external source). By default, Seam will attempt to reset the code. |
| `august_device_programming_delay`                  | Verify that the device has a stable internet connection (e.g. by attempting to lock and unlock the device through Seam) and troubleshoot any connectivity issues that may be causing intermittent or unreliable access to the device.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `august_device_slots_full`                         | Delete existing access codes on the device to free up slots for new access codes. This should be done through Seam if possible.                                                                                                                     |
| `august_lock_bad_access_code_format`               | Review the pin code and name requirements specific to your August device and update the access code on Seam to match these requirements. |
| `august_lock_temporarily_offline`                  | Verify that the device has a stable internet connection (e.g. by attempting to lock and unlock the device through Seam) and troubleshoot any connectivity issues that may be causing intermittent or unreliable access to the device.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `duplicate_code_on_device`                         | Check for [unmanaged access codes](https://docs.seam.co/latest/api-clients/access-codes/list-unmanaged-access-codes) through the provider's app or Seam with the same pin code or name. If a duplicate is found, either delete the duplicate code or convert it to a managed code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `salto_site_user_not_subscribed`                   | Check the Salto user's subscription and your Salto site's subscription limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `smartthings_failed_to_set_after_multiple_retries` | Check for duplicate codes caused by third-party software managing the device. RBoy Apps in particular can cause this, so disable these for devices that are managed using Seam if possible. |
| `smartthings_no_free_slots_available`              | Delete existing access codes on the device to free up slots for new access codes. Note that in addition to the codes managed by Seam, there are 3 other codes on the device.    
| `kwikset_unable_to_confirm_code` | This error is usually caused by a duplicate pin code on the device that was set outside of Seam. Try to update this access code's 'code' value through Seam Console or by using our [access_codes/update endpoint](https://docs.seam.co/latest/api-clients/access-codes/update-an-access-code) |
| `kwikset_unable_to_confirm_deletion`              | You can see a master list of access codes from the Kwikset mobile app (**must be from a mobile device connected to the lock through bluetooth**). If the code is not in the list, it may have already been deleted by a source other than Seam. Please contact us in this case and we will remove our record of the access code. Otherwise we will continue to attempt and confirm deletion of the code on the lock. |
